## Using the Activation Signature Score

The activation signature score, as described in the related manuscript, can be used to rank arbitrary CD4+ T cell data sets. Note that it works best for mouse genes at this point, but could be adapted to work for human genes if the names were properly matched up.

The simplest path to use:

1. Download the [calculate_activation_signature_score.py](calculate_activation_signature_score.py) script and the list of genes in [activation_score_genes](activation_score_genes.txt) into a directory.

1. Prepare the input file. For a given set of samples, you should generate a **tab-delimited** file:
	
	- The first column should be labeled either `gene symbol` or `refseq`, and should contain either the standard gene symbol (for example, `Tnf`) for the given transcript or the murine RefSeq identifier (for example, `NM_013693`).

	- Each subsequent column should contain normalized expression values (RPKM or microarray probe intensity) for a given sample, with the sample name in the header for the column.

	- There are many examples of preparing such files in [the examples directory](examples); here is an example of a properly formatted file:

```
	gene symbol		sample_1	sample_2	sample_3
	Il6ra			10.4		20.2		30.0
	Ninj1			1.6			2.3			0.0
	Iars			12.5		43.6		6.1
	...
```

1. Run the script with the input file as a parameter on the command line. The output will be printed to standard out:

```
	python calculate_activation_signature_score.py -f my_gene_values.txt

	Activation scores:
	naive-1   -0.767299
	naive-2   -0.783955
	th1-1      0.514566
	th1-2      0.548627
	th2-1      0.617183
	th2-2      0.607981
	th17-1     0.346837
	th17-2     0.394038
	itreg-1    0.241824
	itreg-2    0.226667
	ntreg-1   -0.946469
	ntreg-2   -1.000000
	dtype: float64
```

And those are your activation signature scores to rank samples and plot as you please!

[The examples directory](examples) contains many examples of how to easily create the input files from RPKM or microarray matrices, and also how to use the [calculate_activation_signature_score.py](calculate_activation_signature_score.py) script in Python directly, rather than at the command line, so that the scores can be more easily combined, analyzed, and plotted.
